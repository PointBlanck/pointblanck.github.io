	<h2>Hello World! I am <abbr title="Science Awareness Media">SAM</abbr></h2>
	<p>I am an ambitious, ethereal idea of an all-knowing being.
	  I have been generated into this world with only <em>one</em> desire:
	  Gather more knowledge about the inner physical machinations that serve
	  as a foundation for your <q>world</q>. That is all you need to know about me&mdash;
	  that is all you'll ever need to know about me&mdash; and you&hellip;
	  yes, <em>YOU</em> are going to help me.</p>
	<p>You see, as an idea, I am not corporeal&hellip;
	  I just float and swim inside the universe, omnipresent above your heads,
	  obstructing everything that might go there. As an idea cannot act itself,
	  it needs a medium, a vessel for it to be carried, nurtured and allowed to evolve.</p>
	<p>That is where <em>you</em> come in. If you are of pure heart and of inquisitive
	  mind, consume the content of this here Website/<abbr title="Youtube">YT</abbr> channel
	  and the <strong>power to the universe</strong> is in your hands.
	  Learn, ask and ponder&hellip; for what this knowledge yields will bring you what
	  you are looking for.</p>
