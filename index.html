	<h2>The Internet's resource for fun and learning!</h2>
	<h3>Welcome to <abbr>S.A.M.</abbr></h3>
	<p>This site functions as digital library of ongoing, finished projects and record-worthy moments. Physics, Technology and Entertainment content are all going to be present in varying quantities at any given moment in time.</p>
	<p>The goal of this site is to become a digital library of everything we create, whether that is a new dish we invented to satisfy our <em>monstrous</em> appetite, an explanatory video on some topic, an article we wrote, a DIY project or even just what you would call a &ldquo;fun&rdquo; playthrough of a videogame. Should anyone surfing the web find refuge here, they shall be welcomed, taken care of and hopefully leave a little smarter or, at least, a little happier. </p>
      </section>
      <section id="availablecontent">
	<h2>What you can find here</h2>
	<p> All creative projects we have ever produced can be found here. These include:</p>
	<dl>
	  <dt><h3>Videogame Playthroughs &amp; Walkthroughs</h3></dt>
	  <dd>
	    <p>Who doesn't like videogames! This shouldn't be a surprise to anyone. Games that made a particular impact or are record-worthy will be embedded here in the <strong>Videos</strong> section. You can also find them in the <abbr>S.A.M.</abbr> Youtube channel.</p>
	  </dd>
	  <dt><h3>Project Updates</h3></dt>
	  <dd>
	    <p> Keeping ourselves occupied is important. Recording our progress is even more so. Therefore this site will serve as a <dfn>personal log</dfn> (I guess that makes it a p-log?) of updates on projects we are currently undertaking.</p>
	    <p>The scientific and technological nature of the projects are bound to garner some interest online. So, making them public in hopes of raising the fields' awareness/interest, as well as receiving feedback from experts that may come across our work is the smart thing to do.</p>
	    <p>If videos about them are made, they will be placed in the <strong>Videos</strong> section.</p>
	  </dd>
	  <dt><h3>Scientific &amp; Technological Explanatory Articles/Videos</h3></dt>
	  <dd>
	    <p> Spreading understanding and love for science and its role in the modern world is one of our topic directives. Educational topics of interest shall be made into explanatory articles or videos explaining <em>why</em> and <em>how</em> they are interesting.</p>
