	<h2>The Internet's resource for fun and learning!</h2>
	<h3>Welcome to <abbr>S.A.M.</abbr></h3>
	<p>This site functions as digital library of my thoughts,<br>
	  ongoing and finished projects and fun moments in life.<br>
	  Since my interests include Physics, Sciencem Technology<br>
	  and entertainment, that's going to be the main content of<br>
	  this site. But that could change at any moment.</p>
	<p>My goal with this site is for it to become a digital library<br>
	  of my life and life's work as i would like to remember it. If it<br>
	  happens to help somebody in the process or to find it relatable that's<br>
	  a significant bonus.</p>

	<h2>What you can find here</h2>
	<p> This site contains everything that i have a passion about and I feel<br>
	  like sharing with the world. These include:</p>
	<dl>
	  <dt><h3>Videogame Playthroughs &amp; Walkthroughs</h3></dt>
	  <dd>
	    <p>I like to play videogames! This shouldn't be a surprise to anyone.<br>
	      Games that made a particular impact on me or that I feel like I should<br>
	      record them will be annotated here in the <strong>Videos</strong> section.<br>
	      You can also find them in the <abbr>S.A.M.</abbr> Youtube channel.</p>
	  </dd>
	  <dt><h3>Project Updates</h3></dt>
	  <dd>
	    <p>I find myself constantly working on something. But when i don't document<br>
	      my progress I often lose interest and stop. Therefore this site will serve as a<br>
	      <dfn>personal log</dfn> (I guess that makes it a p-log?) for me.</p>
	    <p>The scientific and technological nature of the projects are bound to garner<br>
	      some interest. So I'm making them public in hopes of raising the fields' interest<br>
	      as well as receiving feedback from experts that may come across my content.</p>
	    <p>If I make videos about them they will be placed in the <strong>Videos</strong> section.</p>
	  </dd>
	  <dt><h3>Scientific &amp; Technological Explanatory Articles/Videos</h3></dt>
	  <dd>
	    <p>I love spreading my understanding and love for science and its role in the modern world.<br>
	      Fun topics or cool facts will be made into articles and videos in which I will try to convey<br>
	      how and why they are fun and cool... hopefully successfully</p>
